This is an unofficial implentation of "Graph Random Neural Network"

## Usage Example
* Running one trial on Cora:
```sh run_cora.sh ```
* Running 100 trials with random initializations on Cora:
```sh run100_cora.sh ```
* Calculating the average accuracy of 100 trails on Cora:
```python result_100run.py cora ```

## Running Environment 
I have tested the code with both Tensorflow 1.15 and Tensorflow 2.20.
The accuracy result of Cora is 0.846.
